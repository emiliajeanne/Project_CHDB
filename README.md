# Project_CHDB

Older adults in general have higher rates of poor dental health compared to other age groups. The goal of this project was to analyze dental service utilization for older adutls living in the southeaster PA region (5 counties). To this end, Public Health Management Corporation's (PHMCâ€™s) Community Health Data  Base (CHDB) was analyzed to better understand dental service utilization for older adults in this region. The question I sought to address in this analysis was as follows: what factors are associated with dental services utilization by older adults? 

Included in this repository is the 2012 data file as well as the R code.
